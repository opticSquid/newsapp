# News App


## Problem Statement:

Clone of an app which has more than 50000 downloads.

## Proposed Solution:

[Github repo](https://github.com/opticSquid/newsapp)

For this problem we tried to make a clone of Google News App. We tried to clone the functionally but give a whole new look to the UI which is more accessible. We used the Material 3 design guidelines for theming  the app. This is made for both light and dark mode. You can also share the news article you like to other people through different apps like whatsapp, facebook etc. 


## Functionality and Concepts used:

Lambda Functions

Object Oriented Programming

Model VIew ViewModel (MVVM) architecture

Navigation

Coil Library

Material Design 3

Material Design Principles

Adapting the app for both Light mode and Dark Mode

Other App customization concepts like setting an adaptive app logo etc.


## Future Scopes:

Now the news section is static which can be made dynamic in future. We can also add a weather widget at the top of the home screen. We have to implement different functionalities for which we have made the frontend like counting the likes, searching for an article and curating the news according to user interests
